  "path_overcome_description": "From an early age we are taught how we should act and react to different situations or what feelings and states are valid. It starts in childhood with positive and negative reinforcement, and the glossary of presuppositions keeps growing, be it from observing life around us, our community, partners, media, ads, you name it. In all cases one event or idea does not have to lead to a negative state, and that's what Overcome is here to help you understand.\n\nThis includes traumatic events, mental illnesses, overthinking, worries, fear and more.\n\nDecluttering of those implied cause and effect chains, and in general, of the idea that any one thing must lead to a specific another, provides a previously-unknown level of control over negative or limiting thoughts. You might even catch yourself going through the same cycles after processing them, the story now being different - thoughts arise, now within the awareness that the damaging thoughts were a negative path of assumptions you previously followed that since changed. With repetition the new conclusions strengthen and there will be no inner battle over where you stand on a topic.",

Detaching ourselves from ideas - vague or concrete - allows us to see the world and ourselves clearer every time.\n\nMany sources would gladly tell you who they think you are or what they think you need, with Beyond you can easily see beyond the noise and implied truths so you can live your best life.\n\nBased on ancient and state of the art new teachings, Beyond enables you to peer into the world beyond concepts, effectively helping you easily shed the unwanted by exposing its true nature.",
  "path_beyond_quote": "You don't want a million answers as much as you want a few forever questions. The questions are diamonds you hold in the light. Study a lifetime and you see different colors from the same jewel. The same questions, asked again, bring you just the answers you need just the minute you need them",

  "path_breakthrough_description": "Many ideas prevalent in popular culture are mere aggregates of ideas wrapped in often incomplete stories. Breakthrough rekindles the wondering flame of \"why\" and \"why not\" in order to demistify what are fundamentally incomplete theories touted as facts, clearly apparent once we look beyond their initial layers of reasoning.\n\nBreakthrough asks us to look beyond the stories of the concepts we hold onto in order to see them in a new clearer light. On first notice, many concepts about the self or the world are brutal, unforgiving, yet dig deeper and the story changes.\n\nYou'll be surprised at the real validity of your previous knowledge. Many old truths will show up as really unknowns, untruths or logical fallacies, enabling you to consciously get rid of them and find new possibilities and alternatives",

Connect them and see how deeply they directly and indirectly connect with eachother.\n\nExclusive to ImmaterialAI Plus users - and the first unlocks for Create users only - you can create new types of neurons and synapses from the start of your IAI journey, effectively enabling you to describe your data in more than infinity cubed dimensions. You can also easily filter your library by multiple node types in conjunction with existing filters (e.g. todo, old/new me, focus, etc), as well as configure graph generation to include or exclude any existing and custom lik types",
